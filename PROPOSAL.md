# Neural Network Builder

Amit Sawhney

### Project Description

This C++ application will allow users to utilize User Interface based interaction to construct and customize the architecture of a Neural Network. Visual based construction 	will allow for a better understand of the mathematical flow of Machine Learning and Neural Networks serving as a learning point of building simple neural network flows.

### Background/Passion

In the past few years, I have began to question what kind of Computer Science I want to do. Often, the issue I find is that the intersection between Mathematics and Computer Science doesn't lean the way I would like it to. For the past few summers and semesters I have been highly involved in a multitude of web development based projects. The issue is, web development lacks a substantial mathematical foundation. This has lead me to explore Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning where there exists a strong intersection between the mathematical models used to calculate and control the Neural Networks. 

By developing this application, I will have the opportunity to delve into the complexities of machine learning and apply some of the math I have had the chance to study in Math 415. Moreover, I will be able to develop some of the skills I have scratched the surface of in Machine Learning in previous projects for CS 196 and personal projects. 

### Timeline 

| Week #      | Goals |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Develop the Neural Network from scratch in C++, allow for data to be run in a CLI based model |
| 2 | Build out an automated neural network structure that is rendered based on the architecture of the neural network and a button to run/add your own input on the neural network |
| 3 | Make the front end dynamic in turns of changing the size and values of the neural network |

### Extras
Note: I really don't think I would finish this early, however, if I do:
- Add a way for the user to upload their own training set for the neural network
- Display values of the neural network
- Light animation on the edges of the neural network to create a better user experience
